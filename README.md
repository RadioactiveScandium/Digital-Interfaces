# Digital-Interfaces

Contains knowledge base for understanding and implementation of digital interfaces, such as AMBA APB, AXI etc. The long goal is to convert this repo into a state where it serves as the single goto point for all references for interfaces.

While the kickoff captures only the code and testbench, it is to be gradually expanded into a hub which contains conceptual elements as well.
